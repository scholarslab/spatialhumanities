title: The Spatial Turn and Religion

<p>Scholars in theology and anthropology look to material history of everyday landscape as a reservoir for locating agency from below. In the theology of Paul Tillich, the space of the self formed a major category for understanding the phenomenology of revelation. He distinguished the world as all things grasped, shaped, and formed by language, from the environment immediately surrounding the self, from the abstract space around the individual, whose component parts might go unnoticed. Like Heidegger, Tillich emphasized the distance between individual observer and territory. He proposed space as a vehicle for providing a spiritually-motivated, participatory critique of traditional history. Historians had argued about biography versus the history of the masses. He wanted to push further. "History is the history of groups," he explained. "Concretely speaking, one would have to say that no one can achieve historical greatness who is not received by history-bearing groups."  He wanted historians to go further. "The question of whether individuals or 'masses' determine history must be replaced by an exact description of their interplay."<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Tillich defined space as the category most likely to show the interplay of agency between individual actors, the masses, and historical contingency. Space was the domain of "physical objects" that change little with time.  It was also necessarily the domain of everyday life, a most basic form of agency which no one lacked. "Existing," he explains, meant "above all to have a place among the places of all other being and to resist the threat of losing one's place and with it existence altogether." For all these reasons, spatially-oriented histories were more likely to document the agency of the masses alongside the agency of elites. The painting of cave walls; the settling of house, village or city; or the organization of factory, school, and studio equally revealed popular history.</p>

<p>Based on these categories, Tillich theorized two concerns for history: the identification of "spaces of spirit" where new kinds of agency were gestating, and the "historical time" of causality. "Historical time,” he wrote, “driving toward fulfillment, is actual in the relations of historical spaces.”<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> In other words, telling the chronology of developing landscapes, from the frontier to the city to the ghetto, was a surer way than national history of decoding the history of <em>geist.</em></p>

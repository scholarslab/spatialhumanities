title: The Spatial Turn in Sociology
---
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, the term “space” had a radically promiscuous career: “space” slipped between the “social space” that fin-de-siecle sociologists discovered around the Paris Commune; the “personal space” of midcentury psychologists; and the “Cartesian space” that Marxist geographers after 1968 associated with the liberal government and the rule of capital.<a href="#_ftn1" class="ftn" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the spatial literature that followed, the slippage of the term “space” from body to neighborhood to state was far from accidental. As nineteenth-century discussions of “human geography” shifted to twentieth-century discussions of “place” and “space,” scholars in a range of disciplines played upon exactly this facility of landscape to bring the small and large under the same heading. In the 1940s and 50s, modernist urban planners like Chombart de Lauwe, Maximilian Sorre, and Edward T. Hall developed the study of “proxemics” to explain the study of how individual bodies move in relationship to the built environment around them.<a href="#_ftn2" class="ftn" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> By the 1960s, another generation of historians and sociologists were attracted to the logic of “space” precisely because of this emphasis on multiple scales and multiple agency.<a href="#_ftn3" class="ftn" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> That easy synthesis of personal and political, of multiple scales and temporalities offered a radical alternative to the methods of hierarchical analysis, documentary history, and biographies of great men that dominated the traditional teaching of most disciplines.</p>

title: The Spatial Turn in Architecture
---
<p>In 1952, the British Vernacular Architecture Group was founded to moot the concerns of the method’s growing body of followers. Following the model of the radical walkers, the VAG led its members on walking tours of particular locations.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> The American Vernacular Architecture Forum was founded in 1980, and its founders immediately began taking their fellow-scholars on walking tours of landscapes like Salem, Massachusetts.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The “vernacular landscape” or “vernacular architecture,” like Randall’s “country” and Hoskins’ “landscape,” pointed broadly to the class of buildings excluded from seventeenth-century definitions of “politeness.”<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> As Peter Collins showed in 1965, this excluded category, the “vernacular,” had been identified by nineteenth-century architects like A. W. Pugin and Gilbert George Scott (the first author to use the term in this sense) reappraised the vernacular as a source of aesthetic inspiration.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Vernacular studies typically freighted the observation of everyday landscape with another agenda, the location of nationalist identity. The search for the geographic origins of British identity commenced with Nasse’s <em>Agricultural Community of the Middle Ages and Inclosures of the Sixteenth Century in England</em> (1871), followed upon by Sir Henry Maine’s <em>Village Communities in the East and West </em>and Seebohm’s <em>English Village Community,</em> which traced an undisturbed legacy of Roman political organization in the fields around Hitchin. Both promised that in understanding the shape of ordinary villages, some sacred format of community identity would be disclosed. A. G. Bradley’s <em>Highways and Byways in South Wales</em> (1903) claimed to delineate the line of Norman conquest through Pembrokeshire, across which there was “no social trafficking, no inter-marriage, no sympathy of any kind to speak of” for eight centuries.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> In the unchanging British countryside, they located the materials for a nationalist history of British identity. Even the walking radicals contributed to this discourse.  Randall, for example, asserted with Hilaire Belloc the definite continuity of English institutions since the pre-Roman canton. Belloc even argued that common law had come down untarnished: a native spirit was indissociable from the soil. Randall contested this notion and explained English culture rather as a montage: "Our art is part of the general European culture… Our faith is official Christianity, a Hellenized and Latinized form of an Oriental religion in its many forms or aberrations. … On the other hand, our language is not Roman, but Teutonic in grammatical structure and in the common words.”<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> The birth of the Vernacular Architecture Group was bound more tightly to these nationalist politics than to the radical ones embraced by Hoskins and Beresford. It was for such reasons of an “unduly prominent” obsession with national identity that architecture students at the University of Manchester began a survey of vernacular building types during World War Two. Those documenting the types of popular architecture were frequently motivated by nationalist identity politics, the historic preservation movement, and the interests of architecture schools.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Historic preservation was intensely fruitful in terms of methodology, however. In the 1950s and 60s, R. A. Cordingly and R. W. Brunskill oversaw nation-wide surveys of vernacular building types in Britain. Brunskill eventually produced manifestos documenting a “systematic procedure” for recording instances of vernacular building.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> The tendency to regard material culture as the source of information about popular life inspired reverberations in other disciplines as well. Nineteenth-century archaeology had already influenced Henry Randall, as we have seen. Early in the century, American geographer Fred Kniffen applied housing types to the study of migration of ethnic groups across the American south.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> By the 1950s, American archaeologists and anthropologists like James Deetz and Henry Glassie turned the traditional methods of material history to work on a people’s history of working-class life, mining gravestones and the arrangement of vernacular dwellings.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> For scholars in other disciplines, this shift implied that radical attention to the material culture of everyday life in the modern era could be as instructive as archaeology of the ancient world.</p>

<p>The meetings of both groups encouraged the publication of new works detailing the material experience of popular life, from the many studies published in the <em>Winterthur Portfolio</em> to staples of antebellum scholarship.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> A flood of historical works documented the changing shape of the country house in the era of enclosure, relying on the built environment as a source of a social history that cut across the lines of class.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Others extended to the changing pattern of landholding, village arrangement, and rural institutions.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Like the radical walkers, these later students of vernacular architecture framed the built environment as a source of historical information about aspects of popular social life that left no other traces. Strains of radical walkerdom shot through discussions of material culture in the 1950s and 60s. “The artifact is potentially democratic,” wrote anthropologist Henry Glassie, assailing disciplinary practices that he argued left “most people and most artifacts out of consideration.”<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> Because of that connection, the methods of radical walkers appealed especially to a new generation of radical historians who embraced the politics laid out by Randall, Hoskins, and Beresford. Working-class historians, driven by the search for visual and spatial sources for a history of the masses, mined the vernacular landscape of informal building and design.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a><a class="ftn" id="_ftnref16" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a> Various historians traced the migration of ethnic traditions through the history of housing.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref17" href="#_ftn17">[17]</a> Early feminist historians, too, found a trove of evidence of the undocumented lives of women who left no papers themselves, documented in works such as Dolores Hayden’s history of modern kitchens.<a class="ftn" id="_ftnref18" href="#_ftn18">[18]</a> Material culture had become the major point of entry for studying the story of those who left no other records behind.</p>

title: What is the Spatial Turn?
bodyclass: spatial-turn
---

<p>“Landscape turns” and “spatial turns” are referred to throughout the academic disciplines, often with reference to GIS and the neogeography revolution that puts mapping within the grasp of every high-school student. By “turning” we propose a backwards glance at the reasons why travelers from so many disciplines came to be here, fixated upon landscape, together.</p>

<p>For the broader questions of landscape – worldview, palimpsest, the commons and community, panopticism and territoriality — are older than GIS, their stories rooted in the foundations of the modern disciplines. These terms have their origin in a historic conversation about land use and agency.</p>

  <p>Dr. Jo Guldi was invited by the <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab">Scholars' Lab</a> to contribute a framing narrative and research structure for this <em>Spatial Humanities</em> site.  She is an historian at the Harvard Society of Fellows and a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Digital History at the University of Chicago, as well as a fellow of the <a href="/about/">Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship</a>.  Her book, <em><a href="http://amzn.to/joguldi" title="Roads to Power on Amazon.com">Roads to Power</a></em> (Harvard 2011), describes how Britain invented infrastructure and strangers stopped speaking on the public street.  Jo is currently working on a history of capitalism and its relationship to land use that will focus upon the international land reform movement of the nineteenth century.</p>

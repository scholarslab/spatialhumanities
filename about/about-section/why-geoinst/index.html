title: 'Why #geoinst?'

<p>In April of 2008, <em>Literary and Linguistic Computing</em> published <a href="http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/39.abstract">an overview by Martyn Jessop</a> of factors contributing to a surprising “inhibition” of the use of digitized maps and Geospatial Information Systems in the digital humanities. That GIS approaches -- important for scholarly engagement with space and implace -- have been slow to penetrate a population generally receptive to new practices and technologies begs a discussion of issues at once historical and methodological, institutional and pragmatic. It also demands serious engagement by scholars, programmers, librarians, and advocates for shared data and transparent, flexible, open services. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>'s NEH-funded <em>Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship</em> argued that, to be effective, this engagement must come at many levels simultaneously: we must work to build core infrastructure to support GIS and leverage the strengths of (primarily government and academic) data providers; we must carefully analyze past successes as well as failures in the digital humanities in order to move forward with more robustly-imagined scholarly projects; and we must interrogate both a toolset that has evolved to suit scientific inquiry (that is, positivist models of physical behavior and dense, detailed, precisely-defined data sets, generally synchronic) and our own inherited systems for interpreting the human record within a spatial field. </p>

<p>Above all -- because place and space, whether specifically geo-referenced or wholly conceptual, are common denominators in humanistic disciplines – we must make a concerted effort at supporting and understanding what it is that we do, when we "do GIS."</p>

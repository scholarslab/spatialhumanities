title: About the Institute

<p>In 2009 and 2010, with generous support from the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/odh/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a>, the <a href="http://scholarslab.org/">Scholars&#8217; Lab</a> at the <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/">University of Virginia Library</a> hosted three tracks of an &#8220;Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship.&#8221; This website&#8212;   which our participants dubbed not a clearinghouse but a &#8220;sharing-house&#8221; &#8212; was released in 2011 to serve as a community-driven resource for the spatial humanities.</p>

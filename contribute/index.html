<h2 id="stepbystep">Step By Step</h2>
<p><em>Spatial Humanities Step By Step</em> is <a href="http://spatial.scholarslab.org/step-by-step/">an occasional publication</a> of the Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship and the UVa Library <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab">Scholars' Lab</a>.  It features peer-reviewed tutorials and guides to getting things done in teaching and research with spatial tools and resources.  We created <em>Step By Step</em> to help aggregate high-quality (yet simple-to-follow) tutorials and provide an opportunity for librarians and others to receive professional acknowledgment for the work that goes into creating them.</p>

<h2 id="project">Projects &amp; Groups</h2>
<p>Want to add new projects to the website, or register your group?  We use <a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a> to organize project lists and links to organizations.  Join the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/humanitiesgis/">HumanitiesGIS Zotero group</a> and simply start adding items to the provided categories!  The <em>Spatial Humanities</em> site refreshes its lists from this Zotero collection every night (so be aware that it may take a little while for your contributions to appear).</p>

<p>We have designated a few exemplary groups and undertakings as “Featured Projects.”  Every so often, we will feature a new set of projects, drawn from the HumanitiesGIS Zotero group.  Have a suggestion for one?  Add it to the Zotero group and tweet about it using the hashtag #geoinst.  We'll be happy to take a look!</p>

<h2 id="research"><span id="collections">Research</span></h2>
<p>As with our <a href="#project">Projects &amp; Groups</a> section, by joining the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/humanitiesgis/">HumanitiesGIS Zotero group</a>, you can add new articles, books, websites, and other resources to our categorized bibliography.  The original structure for this research collection was provided by Dr. Joanna Guldi, but the <em>Spatial Humanities</em> community is welcome to take the Zotero group forward in new ways.  Please be aware that new entries will be available to fellow Zotero group members instantly, but may take up to 24 hours to appear on this website.</p>

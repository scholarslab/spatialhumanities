AfricaMap was developed by the Center for Geographic Analysis to make spatial data on Africa easier for researchers to discover and explore.Â  It is an instance of WorldMap which is built on a lightly customized Open Source software stack that includes OpenLayers, ExtJS, TileCache, MapServer, GeoServer, and PostGIS.

AfricaMap requires one of these XML savvy browsers: Firefox 2+, Internet Explorer 7+, and Google Chrome 2+.

"The Newberry Library holds an estimated 500,000 maps issued separately and in atlases and books. Half of these were published before 1900. The map and atlas collections are supported by very extensive holdings in the literature of the history of cartography, cartobibliography and map catalogs, and gazetteer and place name literature. To date, over 70,000 cartographic titles (maps, atlases, and secondary literature) are described in the <a href="http://www.biblioserver.com/newberry/">Newberry Library Cartographic Catalog (NLCC)</a>."

The National Geospatial Digital Archive, "a collecting network for the archiving of geospatial images and data," is an offshoot of the Library of Congress' National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. The NGDA project's objectives include creation of a national network "committed to archiving geospatial imagery and data," development of preservation best practices for archived geospatial data, and collecting and archiving at-risk geospatial data and images.
